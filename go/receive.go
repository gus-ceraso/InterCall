// the maximum accepted frame payload of exactly 64 MiB. A response is
// completely buffered before lookup: a pending ID is claimed and decoded in
// this goroutine, while an unmatched ID stays opaque and its payload is
// never validated. Request admission is one ordered decision under the
// connection lock: terminal selection wins over a buffered request, so a
// frame is never dispatched after terminal has won; a fresh ID transfers
// its complete payload to one new, unbounded handler goroutine; a duplicate
// observed before the prior response enters write admission is a terminal
// protocol error; and a duplicate observed during that write is fully
// buffered as the one deferred next generation without parking this loop,
// while a further same-ID request cannot also queue. Every read failure is
// terminal: an incomplete header or payload is a transport failure, and an
// over-ceiling wire length or structural frame failure is a protocol error;
